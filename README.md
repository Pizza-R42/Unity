# Unity
### Some unity packages that I have worked on:
### RPG Inventory
- A full rpg inventory system using different items, armor, and weapons.
- In the inventory you can equip armor and weapons along and move items around the inventory.
- You are able to split item stacks and place/pickup one item down at a time in a stack.
